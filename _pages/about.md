 Short bio: born in California (1984), Bachelors at UC Berkeley (2006), PhD in Paris (Ecole Normale Supérieure de Cachan 2012), Postdoc at Tokyo Tech (2013). Since 2014 I have been working on new machine learning models for genomic data, as a post-doctoral researcher with Guillaume Bourque at the genome center of McGill University in Montreal.

Research topics: fast and accurate algorithms for convex optimization (clustering, regression, ranking, classification) and discrete optimization (changepoint detection, dynamic programming). The main application domain for the algorithms I develop are in genomic data analysis (DNA copy number, ChIP-seq, etc). For more info, see my Google scholar profile and my list of reproducible papers with accompanying source code.
