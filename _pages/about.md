Research interests: fast and accurate algorithms for convex
optimization (clustering, regression, ranking, classification) and
discrete optimization (changepoint detection, dynamic
programming). The main application domain for the algorithms I develop
are in genomic data analysis (DNA copy number, ChIP-seq, etc); other
applications include neuroscience, audio, internet, sensors,
recommendation and ranking systems.

I think reproducible research is important, so in addition to every
paper I write, I also provide

- A reference implementation of the algorithm(s) described in the paper, typically as an R package.
- Source code for doing the analyses and creating the figures, typically in a GitHub repo.

For more info, see my
[publications](publications/) and [software](software/).
