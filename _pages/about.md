**Jobs**

My lab is recruiting masters and PhD students who are interested in
working on new statistical models, optimization algorithms,
interactive systems, and software for machine learning. If you are
interested in joining, please first [read my mentorship
plan](https://tdhock.github.io/blog/2022/research-mentorship-plan/) to
see what I will expect of you, then [read the application
instructions](http://ml.nau.edu/application.html).

Research interests: fast, accurate, and interpretable algorithms for
learning from large data, using continuous optimization (clustering,
regression, ranking, classification) and discrete optimization
(changepoint detection, dynamic programming). The main application
domains for these algorithms are genomics, neuroscience, medicine,
microbiome, cybersecurity, robotics, satellite/sonar imagery,
climate/carbon modeling.

I think reproducible research is important, so in addition to every
paper I write, I also provide

- A reference implementation of the algorithm(s) described in the paper, typically as an R package.
- Source code for doing the analyses and creating the figures, typically in a GitHub repo.

[publications](publications/) and [software](software/).
