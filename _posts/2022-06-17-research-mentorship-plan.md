Research Mentorship Plan of Toby Dylan Hocking

My main goal when mentoring research students is to help them to make
progress toward becoming independent researchers. Students should
expect to learn how to:
- read research papers, think about possible new ideas and future
  research directions, and review the literature to understand what
  similar ideas have already been researched.
- implement ideas for new machine learning algorithms using
  programming languages such as R, Python, C, C++, JavaScript.
- write code that implements computational cross-validation
  experiments, to compare the speed and prediction accuracy of a new
  machine learning algorithm with previously proposed baselines, and
  create figures/tables that visualize the results.
- write and publish research papers which specifically describe the
  theoretical and empirical novelty of a new algorithm, and cite
  previous research to emphasize what ideas are old/new.
- publish free/open-source code such as R packages on GitHub and CRAN,
  in order to facilitate reproducible research.
- write scholarship/grant applications which describe future research
  directions.
  
Students should expect to do the following:
- keep a lab notebook / research journal on google docs / github
  README / similar. The lab notebook should be organized
  chronologically (most recent at the top), with an entry for every
  day doing research. Write what you did, links to code you
  created/used, result figures/tables, what problems you encountered,
  and specific ideas for next steps.
- have a one-on-one weekly meeting with me, to discuss progress and
  next steps (using the lab notebook to help explain). You should work
  an appropriate amount of time each week in order to make progress
  each week. For example Graduate Research Assistants (GRAs) should
  expect to work 20 hours per week on their research project.
- participate in weekly lab meetings, in which students create and
  deliver 60 minute scientific presentations, and get feedback from
  other research students in the lab who are working on similar
  topics. 
- make backups of all data which is important for doing the above
  activities, by keeping copies in 2+ of the following: 1. your
  personal computer, 2. github, 3. [cloud
  storage](https://tdhock.github.io/blog/2022/cloud-storage/),
  4. external hard drive,
  5. [monsoon](https://in.nau.edu/arc/obtaining-an-account/).

I am aware of differences between research projects and student
capabilities, and I plan to adapt my approach to the specific needs of
each case. Again the goal is to advance your knowledge/skills and the
progress of the specific research idea/project you are working on.
- Some students would like to discuss the specifics of the code they
  are working on (in which case I can do code reviews to help you
  improve your coding skills), and others may want to focus on how to
  write papers including interpretation of result figures/tables.
- Some students may need more or less supervision, including detailed
  comments/suggestions about what exactly they should be working on
  each week, and maybe more or less frequent interactions either in
  person or on email/github.
- In all cases I expect you, the student, to think about what is
  working for you, and what you would like me to do differently in
  order for you to make progress as fast as possible. I am your mentor
  and advisor, and I want you to succeed, so you should feel free to
  tell me how you are doing and what we can do together to improve
  your chances for success.
