Monday was my first day as a new Associate Professor in the Computer
Science department of Université de Sherbrooke. This post explains how
to find my new office.

## Parking

You can park in any of the parking lots with a yellow sign (the yellow
sign is often at the entrance to the parking lot, not on the space
itself). Closest and easiest to find are D1, D7, and D8 (which can be
seen on the map above as P pins on the right where red lines
begin). [Here is a link to the D8 parking pin in google
maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Parking+lot,+Sherbrooke,+QC+J1K+2R1/@45.3804825,-71.9239084,18z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x4cb7b34c11026637:0x6686fd98d6d677f7!8m2!3d45.3807453!4d-71.9242623!16s%2Fg%2F11c1fb82m8?entry=ttu). Make
sure you don't park in a space with a green sign.  After parking, you
need to pay (about 9$CAD) by doing one of the following two things

* find the meter "payez ici" 
* or on your phone, download the bciti+ app and lookup "Université de
  Sherbrooke, QC" under city/ville (make sure to avoid choosing the other entry "Sherbrooke" which is different), then ask for a daily permit
  "Permis journalier" and enter your license plate.

## Find my office

* Walk around to the west building entrance the Faculty of Sciences.
* After entering, turn right and go to the end of the hallway (southwest
  corner of building, this is D4), then continue down the hallway to the
  left/east.

* My office is at the end of the hallway on the right, number D4-1010-11.
