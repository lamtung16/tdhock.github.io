title: Eigen and UNDEBUG
description: Turning on runtime assertion errors for compiled code in R packages
---

Today I was preparing
[an R package](https://github.com/tdhock/cs499-spring2019/tree/master/2019-01-22-nearest-neighbors-code/nearestNeighbors)
for computing the
[nearest neighbors algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm).

I plan to use this R package to explain in my CS499 class how to write
C++ code in an R package. In particular I will explain how to use the
[Eigen C++ template library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/), which makes
it easy to perform matrix operations and dynamic memory allocations.

Eigen has built-in checks/assertions which stop at either compile-time
(for fixed/static matrix sizes that are defined in C++ code) or
run-time (for dynamic matrix sizes that depend on the data). For my
package there are only dynamic matrix sizes, defined using the
`Eigen::VectorXd` etc functions. For example we have

```
Eigen::Map< Eigen::MatrixXd > train_inputs_mat(train_inputs_ptr, nrow, ncol);
Eigen::Map< Eigen::VectorXd > test_input_vec(test_input_ptr, ncol);
```

The first line defines a train feature matrix (nrow x ncol) and the
second line defines a test feature vector (ncol), for a supervised
machine learning problem with nrow observations and ncol features. 

The
[Eigen documentation, page Matrix and vector arithmetic, section Addition and subtraction](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TutorialMatrixArithmetic.html)
says that "The left hand side and right hand side must, of course,
have the same numbers of rows and of columns." Therefore I was expecting the
following code to fail with a run-time assertion error:

```
for(int i=0; i<nrow; i++){
  distance_vec(i) = (train_inputs_mat.row(i)-test_input_vec).norm();
}
```

I was expecting it to fail because `test_input_vec` is a column vector
(ncol x 1) and `train_inputs_mat.row(i)` is a row vector (1 x
ncol). Instead I was seeing the code compile and run, and return the
wrong answer!

I figured out the issue by looking at the compilation command line:
```
g++  -I"/usr/share/R/include" -DNDEBUG  -I"/home/tdhock/R/i686-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.5/RcppEigen/include" -I/home/tdhock/include   -fpic  -g -O2 -fdebug-prefix-map=/build/r-base-3pUaHF/r-base-3.5.1=. -fstack-protector-strong -Wformat -Werror=format-security -Wdate-time -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -g  -c knn.cpp -o knn.o
```

The important part is the `-DNDEBUG` flag which is explained in
[the Eigen Preprocessor Directives documentation](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/TopicPreprocessorDirectives.html).

```
EIGEN_NO_DEBUG - disables Eigen's assertions if defined. 
Not defined by default, unless the NDEBUG macro is defined
(this is a standard C++ macro which disables all asserts).
```

How to turn that off? R controls the compilation, which is explained
in the
[Writing R Extensions manual, section 1.6, writing portable packages](https://cloud.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Writing-portable-packages):

```
Under no circumstances should your compiled code ever call abort or exit: 
these terminate the userâ€™s R process, 
quite possibly including all his unsaved work. 
One usage that could call abort is the assert macro in C or C++ functions, 
which should never be active in production code. 
The normal way to ensure that is to define the macro NDEBUG, 
and R CMD INSTALL does so as part of the compilation flags. 
If you wish to use assert during development 
you can include -UNDEBUG in PKG_CPPFLAGS. 
Note that your own src/Makefile or makefiles in sub-directories 
may also need to define NDEBUG.
```

So that means we can enable the compilation errors by including
`-UNDEBUG` in the `g++` command line. To do that in an R package we
add the following to `src/Makevars`:

```
PKG_CPPFLAGS=-UNDEBUG
```

After doing that, R generates the following compilation command:

```
g++  -I"/usr/share/R/include" -DNDEBUG -UNDEBUG -I"/home/tdhock/R/i686-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.5/RcppEigen/include" -I/home/tdhock/include   -fpic  -g -O2 -fdebug-prefix-map=/build/r-base-3pUaHF/r-base-3.5.1=. -fstack-protector-strong -Wformat -Werror=format-security -Wdate-time -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -g  -c knn.cpp -o knn.o
```

and when I run the R code I get the following runtime assertion error,

```
R: /home/tdhock/R/i686-pc-linux-gnu-library/3.5/RcppEigen/include/Eigen/src/Core/CwiseBinaryOp.h:110: Eigen::CwiseBinaryOp<BinaryOp, Lhs, Rhs>::CwiseBinaryOp(const Lhs&, const Rhs&, const BinaryOp&) [with BinaryOp = Eigen::internal::scalar_difference_op<double, double>; LhsType = const Eigen::Block<Eigen::Map<Eigen::Matrix<double, -1, -1> >, 1, -1, false>; RhsType = const Eigen::Map<Eigen::Matrix<double, -1, 1> >; Eigen::CwiseBinaryOp<BinaryOp, Lhs, Rhs>::Lhs = Eigen::Block<Eigen::Map<Eigen::Matrix<double, -1, -1> >, 1, -1, false>; Eigen::CwiseBinaryOp<BinaryOp, Lhs, Rhs>::Rhs = Eigen::Map<Eigen::Matrix<double, -1, 1> >]: Assertion `aLhs.rows() == aRhs.rows() && aLhs.cols() == aRhs.cols()' failed.
```

Although the error message is pretty incomprehensible (it does not
tell me the line number in my code which is problematic), I would
argue that it is better than silently returning the wrong answer.

If the code is compiled and run interactively, one line at a time, it
should be relatively simple to determine which line introduced the
error. Another way to determine where the error happens is debugging
or inserting print statements.
