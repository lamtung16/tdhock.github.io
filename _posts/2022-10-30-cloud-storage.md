title: NAU Cloud Storage
description: Different options for internal and external sharing
---

Here is a summary of my current understanding of cloud storage options
available to us at NAU, and to our collaborators.

- [OneDrive](https://in.nau.edu/its/onedrive-for-business/): 1TB free,
  unable to share with anyone on the internet (only with NAU or people
  on a list who login).
- [GoogleDrive](https://in.nau.edu/its/google-drive/): 25GB free (able
  to share with anyone on the internet without having them login).
- [Dropbox](https://nau.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&article=KB0014469):
  unlimited for $180 per year.
- [Bonsai](https://in.nau.edu/its/bonsai/): NAU students have access
  to 6 gigabytes of free storage, and faculty and staff have access to
  25 gigabytes of free storage. Only you have access (no
  sharing). Backed up daily for over a month and are accessible from
  any computer with an Internet connection.
- [NAUShares](https://in.nau.edu/its/naushares/) can be accessed by
  any student, faculty, or staff member if they have been given proper
  permission to access their departments' NAUShares. (but no access by
  outside collaborators)

On Monsoon PIs have 1TB free storage under their /project directory,
and those files can be shared via:

- [Globus](https://www.globus.org/): collaborators can send you files
  too, setup group in globus, then setup a share, then collaborators
  can upload to some directory on your monsoon project space.
- [rcdata](https://in.nau.edu/arc/data-portal/): Monsoon projects web
  sharing. You run publish_data on monsoon, then others can access
  here,
