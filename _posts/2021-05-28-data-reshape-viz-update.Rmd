## R approach for histogram

My [paper about regular expressions for data
reshaping](https://github.com/tdhock/nc-article) was recently accepted
into R journal. I used visualization of the iris data as a example to
motivate reshaping. Recall the iris data look like this,

```{r iris}
head(iris)
```

To make a facetted histogram, we need to combine the first four
columns into a single column. To do that we define a regular
expression to match those column names, then use that to reshape and
visualize.

```{r iris.long}
(iris.long <- nc::capture_melt_single(
  iris, part=".*", "[.]", dim=".*", value.name="cm"))
library(ggplot2)
ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(
    cm, fill=Species),
    color="black",
    bins=20,
    data=iris.long)+
  facet_grid(part ~ dim, labeller=label_both)
```

Recently data.table [merged my
PR](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/pull/4731) which
implements similar functionality:

```{r data.table.measure}
library(data.table)
one.iris <- data.table(iris[1,])
nc::capture_melt_single(one.iris, part=".*", "[.]", dim=".*")
data.table::melt(
  one.iris, measure.vars=measure(part, dim, pattern="(.*)[.](.*)"))
```

This functionality is also implemented in the `tidyr` package:

```{r tidyr.long}
pattern <- "(.*)[.](.*)"
tidyr::pivot_longer(
  one.iris,
  cols=matches(pattern),
  names_to=c("part", "dim"),
  names_pattern=pattern)
```

Note that in the `tidyr` version above the pattern needs to be
repeated in the `cols` and the `names_pattern` arguments.

## Comparison with python approaches for histogram

I was curious to investigate the state of python modules for
performing the same computations. Is it as easy as in R? The intent of
the R code above is to use a regex pattern to specify: (1) the set of
columns to melt/reshape/unpivot, and (2) the data to capture in the
`dim` and `part` columns of the output. So my code below tries to
translate that idea into python.

If you are limited to using pandas, this is possible but not easy. My
first attempt at the data reshaping involved `melt`,

```{python}
import pandas as pd
one_iris=pd.DataFrame({
    "Sepal.Length":[5.1],
    "Sepal.Width":[3.5],
    "Petal.Length":[1.4],
    "Petal.Width":[0.2],
    "Species":"setosa"})
pattern = "(?P<part>.*)[.](?P<dim>.*)"
col_extract = one_iris.columns.to_series().str.extract(pattern)
id_vars = [
    name for name,matched in
    zip(one_iris.columns, col_extract.iloc[:,0].notna())
    if not matched]
one_long = one_iris.melt(id_vars=id_vars)
pd.concat([one_long["variable"].str.extract(pattern), one_long], axis=1)
```

That was complicated! Luckily there is another function,

```{python}
import janitor
import re
names_to = list(re.compile(pattern).groupindex.keys())
one_iris.pivot_longer(
    index="Species",
    names_pattern=pattern,
    names_to=names_to)
```

That was much easier! Note that the names and sub-patterns for each
capture group were defined together in the same regular expression
string literal, which was then compiled to get the group names to pass
as the `names_to` argument. Note that the python iris data has
slightly different column names (no dot),

```{python}
iris_url = "https://raw.github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/master/pandas/tests/io/data/csv/iris.csv"
iris_wide = pd.read_csv(iris_url)
iris_wide
```

So we must repeat those steps with a different pattern,

```{python}
pattern = "(?P<part>Sepal|Petal)(?P<dim>Length|Width)"
names_to = list(re.compile(pattern).groupindex.keys())
iris_long = iris_wide.pivot_longer(
    index="Name",
    names_pattern=pattern,
    names_to=names_to,
    values_to="cm")
iris_long
```

After that there are a number of modules to consider for making the
histogram. Again my goal is to replicate the intent of the R ggplot2
code, which says "each Species is a different color, and each part/dim
is a different panel." At first I thought it may be possible to use
the default pandas plotting methods, but it is clear from [the
docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html)
that there is no easy way to specify a variable to use for plotting in
different panels (a la `facet_grid`). Same for matplotlib and bokeh. A
python alternative is [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io), which
does implement facets:

```{python}
import altair as alt
chart = alt.Chart(iris_long).mark_bar().encode(
    alt.X("cm:Q", bin=True),
    y='count()',
    color="Name"
).facet(row="part", column="dim")
# need to do chart.show() then click save as PNG.
```

## R approach for scatterplot comparing parts

Next plot from the paper was a facetted scatterplot comparing
parts... are Petals longer and/or wider than Sepals? To do that we
need to change the reshape operation so we output a `Sepal` and a
`Petal` column. In R this amounts to changing one of the regex group
names to a special value that is recognized as the keyword for
creating multiple output columns.

| Package  | nc                      | data.table         | tidyr          |
| Function | `capture_melt_multiple` | `melt` + `measure` | `pivot_longer` |
| Keyword  | `column`                | `value.name`       | `.value`       |

```{r}
nc::capture_melt_multiple(one.iris, column=".*", "[.]", dim=".*")
data.table::melt(
  one.iris, measure.vars=measure(value.name, dim, pattern="(.*)[.](.*)"))
pattern <- "(.*)[.](.*)"
tidyr::pivot_longer(
  one.iris,
  cols=matches(pattern),
  names_to=c(".value", "part"),
  names_pattern=pattern)
```

Doing that for the entire data set then plotting yields

```{r}
(iris.parts <- nc::capture_melt_multiple(iris, column=".*", "[.]", dim=".*"))
ggplot()+
  coord_equal()+
  geom_abline(slope=1, intercept=0, color="grey")+
  geom_point(aes(
    Sepal, Petal, color=Species),
    data=iris.parts)+
  facet_grid(. ~ dim, labeller=label_both)
```

## Python approach for scatterplot comparing parts

Python janitor can do the reshape (same `.value` keyword as in R to
indicate multiple outputs), but we can't use a regex with named groups
this time, because the dot is not allowed:

```{python err, error=TRUE, purl=TRUE}
re.compile("(?P<.value>Sepal|Petal)(?P<dim>Length|Width)")
```

Well I guess you could use do the following,

```{python}
names_pattern = "(?P<_value>Sepal|Petal)(?P<dim>Length|Width)"
names_to = [x.replace("_", ".") for x in re.compile(names_pattern).groupindex.keys()]
names_to
iris_parts = iris_wide.pivot_longer(
    index="Name",
    names_pattern=pattern,
    names_to=names_to)
iris_parts
```

Now let's try to plot with altair again,

```{python}
import altair as alt
chart = alt.Chart(iris_parts).mark_circle().encode(
    x="Sepal",
    y="Petal",
    color="Name"
).facet(column="dim")
```

![scatterplot of iris](/assets/img/2021-05-28-data-reshape-viz-update/iris_altair_scatter_parts.png)

Two ggplot2 features which are missing in the altair plot above are
[`coord_equal`](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/issues/1628) and
[`geom_abline`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62854174/altair-draw-a-line-in-plot-where-x-y). These
are useful when you want to emphasize that the x and y axes have the
same units, so you can see if the data are above the
diagonal, are Petals longer/wider than Sepals?

So did you read [my blog tutorial from last
year](https://tdhock.github.io/blog/2020/data-manipulation/), in which
we explored python datatable and plotnine? Well, datatable still has
not implemented the reshape/melt functionality, and plotnine still
seems to have the best ggplot2 emulation:

```{python}
import plotnine as p9
gg_scatter_parts = p9.ggplot()+\
    p9.geom_abline(
        slope=1, intercept=0,
        color="grey")+\
    p9.geom_point(
        p9.aes(x="Sepal", y="Petal", fill="Name"),
        iris_parts)+\
    p9.facet_grid(". ~ dim", labeller="label_both")+\
    p9.coord_equal()
```

```{python saveone, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
def p9_save(g, name):
    out_png = img_path+"iris_p9_"+name+".png"
    with warnings.catch_warnings():
        warnings.simplefilter("ignore")
        g.save(out_png, width=5, height=5)
    web_link = out_png.replace(repo_dir, "")
    print('![plot of %s](%s)'%(name, web_link))
p9_save(gg_scatter_parts, "scatter_parts")
```

So janitor + plotnine works well here! Incidentally, we can also do
this reshape with plain pandas:

```{python}
iris_wide["id"] = iris_wide.index
pd.wide_to_long(
    iris_wide, ["Petal", "Sepal"],
    i="id", j="dim", sep="", suffix="(Width|Length)"
).reset_index()
```

So `pd.wide_to_long` in python is similar to `stats::reshape` in R, in
that (1) two groups are assumed, and (2) it is assumed the `.value` /
`value.name` / `column` group comes first. In other words, these work
for this reshape operation, but they do NOT work for the similar
reshape in the next section (without some pre-processing of column
names).

## R approach for scatterplot comparing dims

In this section we reshape into `Length` and `Width` columns. In R we
just have to move the keyword from the first to the second group,

```{r}
nc::capture_melt_multiple(one.iris, part=".*", "[.]", column=".*")
data.table::melt(
  one.iris, measure.vars=measure(part, value.name, pattern="(.*)[.](.*)"))
pattern <- "(.*)[.](.*)"
tidyr::pivot_longer(
  one.iris,
  cols=matches(pattern),
  names_to=c("part", ".value"),
  names_pattern=pattern)
```

Doing that for the entire data set then plotting yields

```{r}
(iris.dims <- nc::capture_melt_multiple(iris, part=".*", "[.]", column=".*"))
ggplot()+
  coord_equal()+
  geom_abline(slope=1, intercept=0, color="grey")+
  geom_point(aes(
    Length, Width, color=Species),
    data=iris.dims)+
  facet_grid(. ~ part, labeller=label_both)
```

## Python approach for scatterplot comparing dims

As in the previous problem, we can use janitor + plotnine:

```{python}
names_pattern = "(?P<part>Sepal|Petal)(?P<_value>Length|Width)"
names_to = [x.replace("_", ".") for x in re.compile(names_pattern).groupindex.keys()]
names_to
iris_dims = iris_wide.pivot_longer(
    index="Name",
    names_pattern=pattern,
    names_to=names_to)
iris_dims
gg_scatter_dims = p9.ggplot()+\
    p9.geom_abline(
        slope=1, intercept=0,
        color="grey")+\
    p9.geom_point(
        p9.aes(x="Length", y="Width", fill="Name"),
        iris_dims)+\
    p9.facet_grid(". ~ part", labeller="label_both")+\
    p9.coord_equal()
```

```{python savedims, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
p9_save(gg_scatter_dims, "scatter_dims")
```

## No integrated type conversion in python

In R we can do type conversion during the reshape,

```{r}
DT <- data.table(id=1, child1_sex="M", child1_age=34, child2_sex="F")
pattern <- "(.)_(.*)"
names_transform <- list(number_int=as.integer, .value=identity)
tidyr::pivot_longer(
  DT, matches(pattern),
  names_to=names(names_transform),
  names_transform=names_transform,
  names_pattern=pattern)
print(
  melt(DT, measure.vars=measurev(
    names_transform, pattern=pattern, multiple.keyword=".value"))
, class=TRUE)
number_pattern <- list(number_int=".", as.integer)
print(
  nc::capture_melt_multiple(
    DT, number_pattern, "_", column=".*", fill=TRUE)
, class=TRUE)
```

Note that `tidyr` and `data.table` syntax require definition of the
regex `pattern` separately from the names/conversions which are
defined in `names_transform`. In contrast, the `nc` syntax allows
definition of these three related pieces of information together in
group-specific sub-pattern list variables, for example
`number_pattern`. The results above show that `number_int` is indeed
of type `int` --- is this possible in python?

```{python}
DT = pd.DataFrame({
    "id":[1],
    "child1_sex":["M"],
    "child1_age":[34],
    "child2_sex":["F"]
})
DT_long = DT.pivot_longer(
    index="id",
    names_pattern="(.)_(.*)",
    names_to = ["number", ".value"])
DT_long
type(DT_long["number"][0])
```

There is no `names_transform` argument in python (`number` is actually a
string), but you can always do the transform after the fact (less
efficient/convenient),

```{python}
DT_long["number_int"] = DT_long["number"].astype(int)
DT_long
type(DT_long["number_int"][0])
```

## Conclusions

So in conclusion the python `pivot_longer` is a decent data reshaping
tool, but still is not quite as fully featured as the software we have
in R. In particular we observed the following:

* Named capture groups are supported in python, and are useful since
  they allow defining the capture group names and sub-patterns
  together in the regex string literal. This is an advantage over R
  tidyr, which does not support named groups because it uses the ICU C
  regex library (does not export of group names to R). Even better (in
  terms of keeping related information together) is the R nc syntax,
  which allows defining a list for each capture group that contains:
  (1) group name, (2) regex pattern, and (3) type conversion function.
* Named capture groups can not be easily used with python
  `pivot_longer` for reshape to multiple output columns. This is
  because `pivot_longer` outputs multiple value columns when
  `names_to=".value"` is specified, but `.value` can not be used as a
  capture group name in the regex. We showed a workaround using the
  regex capture group named `_value` and renamed to `.value`.
* R packages provide integrated type conversion, but python
  `pivot_longer` does not (although types can be converted after the
  reshape operation).

Of the python modules for visualization,

* neither bokeh, nor the pandas plot method, nor matplotlib, supports
  facets (subplots defined via column names).
* altair supports facets but does not support `coord_equal` and
  `geom_abline`.
* plotnine seems to be the best way in python to emulate the
  functionality we have in R with ggplot2.
