title: Debugging C/C++ code
description: Essential tools: valgrind and gdb
---

Today in office hours, I explained how to use valgrind, to a student
from my CS105 class. [Here is a good
tutorial](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~heechul/courses/eecs678/F16/labs/lab2/GDBLab.pdf)
about how to use valgrind to find memory errors, and how to use gdb
for debugging. TODO expand to show emacs integration.
