title: Debugging C code
description: valgrind and gdb are essential tools
---

Today in office hours, I explained how to use valgrind, to a student
from my CS105 class. [Here is a good
tutorial](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~heechul/courses/eecs678/F16/labs/lab2/GDBLab.pdf),

about how to use valgrind to find memory errors, and how to use gdb
for debugging. TODO expand to show emacs integration.
