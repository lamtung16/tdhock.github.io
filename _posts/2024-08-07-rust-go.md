title: Rust versus Go
description: Similarities and Differences
---

Today I read [Rust vs Go in
2024](https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/rust-vs-go) and one thing he forgot to mention is R support, haha.

One of the main things he emphasized is that Go has a garbage
collector/runtime whereas Rust does not -- in fact it uses the same
foreign function interface as C. That is probably why R has better
support for Rust than for Go.

## Rust

Currently there seems to be pretty good support for Rust code in R
packages, 

* for details about how to write an R package that contains Rust code,
  read [rextendr package
  vignette](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/rextendr/vignettes/package.html). There is some secret sauce in the Makefile.
* to find out how to get your package on CRAN, read [CRAN compliant
  extendr
  packages](https://extendr.github.io/rextendr/dev/articles/cran-compliance.html).

I believe some CRAN packages use Rust code, not sure which though. I
very lightly co-mentored a R-GSOC student
[polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/r-polars) last year, and so I
thought polars may be on CRAN by now, but it is not (Archived on CRAN
for policy violations, github says to install from R-universe).

Josiah Perry seems to be a lead rextendr dev, so I thought one of his
packages may have Rust and be on CRAN.

* [rsgeo](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/rsgeo/) was archived for policy violation.
* [arcpbf](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_arcpbf.html) currently has check ERRORs on CRAN, so may be removed soon.

Its DESCRIPTION says "SystemRequirements: Cargo (Rust's package
manager), rustc" but I don't have that on this computer, so
`install.packages` tells me:

```
* installing *source* package ‘arcgisutils’ ...
** package ‘arcgisutils’ correctement décompressé et sommes MD5 vérifiées
** using staged installation
checking for rustc... no
----------------------- RUST NOT FOUND---------------------------
The 'rustc' compiler was not found on the PATH. Please install Rust
from: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

Alternatively, you may install Rust from your OS package manager:
 - Debian/Ubuntu: apt-get install rustc
 - Fedora/CentOS: dnf install rustc
 - macOS: brew install rustc
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ERROR: configuration failed for package ‘arcgisutils’
```

## Go

There is an experiment or proof of concept for Go+R under [rstats-go
on GitHub](https://github.com/rstats-go), but I have not heard of
anyone putting Go code on CRAN.
