### Goals to promote

The goal of Toby Dylan HOCKING's [LASSO lab](https://lassolab.org) is
to produce high-quality scientific research in the areas of Learning
Algorithms, Statistical Software, and Optimization. To achieve that
goal, it is important that we promote an environment of open
scientific inquiry, mutual respect, understanding, safety, diversity,
equity, and inclusion. To promote these goals, we have adopted this
Code of Conduct.

### Behavioral expectations

As members of the LASSO lab, we pledge to respect all other members,
and collaborators, with whom we interact in our research work.

We are committed to making participation in the LASSO lab a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of
experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race,
ethnicity, age, religion, etc.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of
sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks,
trolling, public or private harassment, insults, inappropriate
touching, or other unprofessional conduct.
