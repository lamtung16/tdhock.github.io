title: useR! 2017 debrief
description: summary of interesting work I saw in Brussels
---

I attended [useR!2017](https://www.user2017.brussels/) in Brussels in
July, and tomorrow during Guillaume Bourque's lab meeting, I will
present [a debriefing](https://github.com/tdhock/useR2017-debrief) of
interesting things that I saw there. There are links to videos of the
presentations!
