description: Please read if you want to do research under my supervision

## Mentorship plan reading and writing application

Before doing this application, please first read [my mentorship
plan](https://tdhock.github.io/blog/2022/research-mentorship-plan/),
which will help you understand what I expect of my research students.
In the first section of your application, please write a summary of
your understanding of my mentorship plan (in your own words, do not
copy word for word from my mentorship plan). Also write about what
kind of work/study style you have, and what frequency/kind of
interactions with me you expect to have.

## Technical reading and writing application

To work in the machine learning research lab, it is important to be
able to read and understand machine learning research papers. It is
also important to have excellent written communication
skills. Therefore I need to judge your reading/writing skills and the
quality of your scientific comprehension/ideas. Please take some time
to choose [one of my
publications](https://tdhock.github.io/publications/) that is
interesting to you, and for which you think there would be an
interesting future research project/publication. Then write me an
email, in your own words (not copying from the publication), with

* Background: what is the problem setting and data? For example, in regression the data is a n x p input/feature matrix, an n-vector of outputs/labels, problem is learning a function which takes a p-dimensional input/feature vector and returns a real-valued output/prediction.
* Previous work: what are the existing approaches for that problem, and what are their drawbacks that motivate a new algorithm? For example, in regression there are linear models, neural networks, boosting, etc.
* Novelty: what are the new ideas presented in the paper? Are they theoretical or empirical, or both? For example, the paper could use existing models/data and present a new proof about the optimality/speed of an existing algorithm, or it could use existing algorithms/data with a new neural network model architecture, or it could present new benchmark data sets for comparing various existing algorithms/models.
* Results: what comparisons were done to show that the new idea is interesting/useful in theory and/or in practice? For example, you could compare the test accuracy and computation time for different regression algorithms on various data sets.
* Future work: what are some of your ideas for new research papers that could be written as a follow up to this one? Justify why these ideas are sufficiently novel that they warrant a new paper describing them. Also describe what kinds of theoretical and empirical arguments you would need in that future paper. Please answer this point very specifically, because it will be helpful to define your first research project with me.

Make sure to use full sentences and paragraphs, and follow [Mark Schmidt's writing guidelines](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Courses/Notes/writing.pdf), so I can evaluate the quality of your English writing skills. Ideally, please typeset your response using LaTeX and/or Overleaf, and include section headings and a bibliography with at least one citation to the paper you read.

## Coding application

Writing code, and making figures, are important parts of machine
learning research. Please write a summary of one or two of your
previous projects, which answers the following questions.

* one project should involve substantial coding. Please do not include
  the code in your application, but please do include a link to your
  code (on GitHub etc). Please write about the primary challenge of
  the coding project, and what coding techniques you used. Are you
  proud of this coding project? What would you do differently next
  time you need to write code to solve a similar problem?
* one project should involve creating a figure using code. Please
  include a copy of the figure in your application, and a link to the
  code you used to make that figure. Please write about why you made
  the figure, and the main message you wanted to communicate with that
  figure. If you have not ever used code to make figures, please read
  [Chapter 2 of the Animint2
  Manual](https://rcdata.nau.edu/genomic-ml/animint2-manual/Ch02-ggplot2.html),
  and use one of the exercises to satisfy this application requirement.
