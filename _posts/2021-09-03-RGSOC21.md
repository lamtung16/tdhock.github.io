title: Ten years of R project in Google Summer of Code
description: Some success stories from my participation
---

This week all students who passed GSOC'21 were announced. That
[includes 21 student projects with mentors from the R project for
statistical
computing](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5111129224773632/?sp-page=3). Since
2012 I am an administrator for R project in Google Summer of Code
(R-GSOC), and my job as an admin is to recruit mentors that propose
coding projects, and then help mentors find students to work on those
projects. I first heard about GSOC at the international useR 2011
conference in Warwick, from Claudia Beleites, who gave a talk and
co-authored an R News article describing the experience, [R's
Participation in the Google Summer of Code
2011](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-2/RJournal_2011-2.pdf).
During the conference Claudia invited me to serve as administrator, so
I began service as admin starting in 2012. So now it has been ten
years, 2012-2021, wow!

When I began as admin in 2012 we were using the now-defunct RWiki for
organization. [Here is a list of projects
2008-2014](https://github.com/hwborchers/gsoc-r/blob/master/README.md). You
can still look at the old wiki pages on the Internet Archive's wayback
machine,
- [2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20101210010736/http://rwiki.sciviews.org/doku.php?id=developers:projects:gsoc2010)
- [2011](https://web.archive.org/web/20131114083250/http://rwiki.sciviews.org/doku.php?id=developers:projects:gsoc2011)
- [2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20131109220427/http://rwiki.sciviews.org/doku.php?id=developers:projects:gsoc2012)
- [2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20131209070027/http://rwiki.sciviews.org/doku.php?id=developers:projects:gsoc2013)
- [2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20140423081746/http://rwiki.sciviews.org/doku.php?id=developers:projects:gsoc2014)

Here is a list of [the newer years](https://github.com/orgs/rstats-gsoc/repositories) (since 2015) on GitHub.

Now we use a GitHub wiki to organize. The most recently completed year
is
[2021](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2021/wiki/table%20of%20proposed%20coding%20projects),
and you can post ideas for next year on
[2022](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2022/wiki/table%20of%20proposed%20coding%20projects).

Since 2013 I have mentored various students in R-GSOC coding projects.
Here are some of my R-GSOC mentorship success stories:

- Anirban Chetia
  (India). [testComplexity](https://github.com/Anirban166/testComplexity)
  GSOC'20 and [directlabels](https://github.com/tdhock/directlabels)
  GSOC'21, new master student at NAU as of Fall'21!
- Diego Urgell (Mexico City), [BinSeg
  package](https://github.com/diego-urgell/BinSeg),
  GSOC'21. Implements the classic binary segmentation algorithm which
  is useful as a baseline algorithm to run in my papers about new
  optimal changepoint algorithms, for example [Labeled Optimal
  Partitioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13967) and [Linear time
  dynamic programming for the exact path of optimal models selected
  from a finite set](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02808).
- Julian Stanley (MIT grad student),
  [gfpopgui](https://julianstanley.github.io/gfpopgui/)
  package. Graphical user interface for Graph-constrained optimal
  changepoint models, useful for experimenting with complex graphs as
  shown in the [gfpop](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03646) paper, etc.
- Sanchit Saini, [rtracklayer](https://github.com/lawremi/rtracklayer)
  package, GSOC'20, but [kept
  contributing](https://github.com/lawremi/rtracklayer/commits?author=sanchit-saini)
  long after GSOC was over.
- Anuraag Srivastava (NAU master student),
  [opart](https://github.com/as4378/opart) package, GSOC'19.
- Qin Wenfeng (China), re2r package. Google's fast and secure
  [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2) regular expression library.
- Many students over the years,
  [animint2](https://github.com/tdhock/animint2) package. By far the
  best student who worked on animint was Carson Sievert who now works
  for RStudio, and has done a lot for interactive graphics in R.
