I met Wayne Oldford of the University of Waterloo Department of
Statistics and Actuarial Science on Monday, and he showed me his
awesome loon package for interactive exploratory data visualization in
R. This post explains how I got it to work on my computer. First I
tried downloading/installing loon from CRAN, and I got the following
error message:

Actually the problem is that the tcltk package can not be loaded:
```
> library(tcltk)
Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘tcltk’:
 .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'tcltk', details:
  call: fun(libname, pkgname)

That "Tcl/Tk support is not available on this system" made me think that I need to recompile R with tcltk support. So I downloaded R-3.4.2 source code and I when I ran the configure script I saw the following:

```
tdhock@recycled:~/R/R-3.4.2$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME 
...
checking for tclConfig.sh... no
checking for tclConfig.sh in library (sub)directories... no
checking for tkConfig.sh... no
checking for tkConfig.sh in library (sub)directories... no
checking for tcl.h... no
...
  Interfaces supported:      X11
...
```

I guessed that I needed to install tcltk dev libraries, which is done via the following on my Ubuntu system:

```
sudo aptitude install tcl-dev tk-dev
```

After that I got the following output from the configure script:

```
tdhock@recycled:~/R/R-3.4.2$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME --with-blas --with-lapack --enable-R-shlib
...
checking for tclConfig.sh... no
checking for tclConfig.sh in library (sub)directories... /usr/lib/tclConfig.sh

checking tk.h presence... yes
checking for tk.h... yes
checking whether compiling/linking Tcl/Tk code works... yes
...
  Interfaces supported:      X11, tcltk
...
```

Then I did `make` and `make install` and then,

```

Finally it works!

```

demo("loon", package="loon")
