\section{\sc Research Interests}

Machine learning algorithms, statistical software, and data
visualization techniques. Emphasis on efficient algorithms for large
datasets, based on constrained optimization (regression,
classification, ranking, clustering, segmentation, changepoint
detection, survival analysis). Application domains include medicine,
genomics, neuroscience, audio, internet, sensors, recommendation
systems.
